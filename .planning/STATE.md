# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-09)

**Core value:** Every upstream GSD command works correctly on a jj-only repo without git — full GSD workflow on a jj backend with no degradation in behavior or test coverage.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Adapter Foundation + Git Backend

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Adapter Foundation + Git Backend)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-09 — Roadmap created (5 phases, 86 v1 requirements mapped, 100% coverage)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-Phase-1: VCS adapter abstraction (frozen-object factory, TypeScript-first with `dist-cjs/` build target) is the highest-leverage move; Branch-by-Abstraction over Strangler Fig because git is deep in the SDK.
- Pre-Phase-1: jj backend uses squash-based commit model (`jj squash -B @ -k -m`); `jj commit` is never invoked.
- Pre-Phase-1: Working-copy auto-snapshot is allowed by default; `--ignore-working-copy` is never passed by adapter code.
- Pre-Phase-1: Orchestrator pre-creates each subagent's head change and workspace (octopus structure created lazily on first fan-out).
- Pre-Phase-1: Hooks Tier 1 only in v1 — colocated default + jj-native non-colocated direct trigger; PATH-shim wrapper deferred to v2.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Requirement-count discrepancy:** REQUIREMENTS.md self-reports "78 v1 requirements across 13 categories" but actually contains 86 requirements across 15 categories (added SQUASH and BROWN as separate sections during requirement definition, plus larger category sizes). Roadmap maps the actual 86. REQUIREMENTS.md footer should be reconciled at next phase transition.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:
