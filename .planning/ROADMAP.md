# Roadmap: GSD jj-port

**Mode:** standard
**Created:** 2026-05-09

## Overview

Port GSD from a git-only toolkit to a dual-backend (git + jj) toolkit while preserving full upstream feature parity. The roadmap follows a strict horizontal-layers + Branch-by-Abstraction sequence: introduce the `VcsAdapter` seam with a 1:1 git backend first, migrate every git call site to it, then layer in the jj backend (squash/refs/conflict core → workspaces+hooks → command translations → brownfield migration). Each phase strictly unblocks the next.

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 MVP** — Phases 1, 2, 2.1, 3, 03.1, 4, 5, 6 (shipped 2026-05-14) — see `.planning/MILESTONES.md`
- ✅ **v1.1 first upstream sync** — Phase 7 (shipped 2026-05-14) — see `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`
- 📋 *No active milestone — run `/gsd-new-milestone` to start v1.2*

## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.0 MVP (Phases 1, 2, 2.1, 3, 03.1, 4, 5, 6) — SHIPPED 2026-05-14</summary>

- [x] **Phase 1: Adapter Foundation + Git Backend** — VcsAdapter interface, git-only 1:1 backend, parameterized test harness, no-raw-git lint guard. (5/5 plans, completed 2026-05-09)
- [x] **Phase 2: Bulk Call-Site Migration (Still Git-Only)** — Every `execSync('git …')` in `sdk/src/query/*.ts` and `bin/lib/*.cjs` migrated to the adapter. (12/12 plans)
- [x] **Phase 2.1 (INSERTED): VCS Abstraction Audit — Drop Git-Only Concepts** — Reshape cross-backend surface; `expr.commit` → `expr.rev`, `currentBranch` → `currentBookmarks`, gitDir/gitCommonDir → `gitOnly` namespace. (9/9 plans)
- [x] **Phase 3: jj Backend Core — Squash, Refs, Conflict** — `sdk/src/vcs/backends/jj.ts` implementing every adapter contract verb (jj-colocated CI lane as allow-failure). (7/7 plans, completed 2026-05-12)
- [x] **Phase 03.1 (INSERTED): make tests run faster** — vitest parallelism baseline + L1/L2 levers + final ratio recorded. (5/4 plans)
- [x] **Phase 4: Workspaces + Octopus Structure + Hooks** — `vcs.workspace.{add,forget,prune,reap}` bodies + `acquireJjWriteLock` RAII + lazy octopus helpers + pre-commit/pre-push hook wiring + SDK `hooks.fire` bridge. (7/7 plans, completed 2026-05-13). Known gap: A3 colocated pre-commit (carries into v1.2).
- [x] **Phase 5: Command Translations + Brownfield Validation + CI Hardening** — Every upstream command verified end-to-end on jj; workflow markdown and agent prompts rewritten; CI matrix graduates jj-backend to required-blocking. (8/5 original + 3 gap-closure plans)
- [x] **Phase 6: Brownfield jj Migration** — Sticky `vcs.adapter` flip + `.planning/` SHA→change_id rewriter + `/gsd-migrate-vcs` command + dogfood validation. (4/4 plans)

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.1 first upstream sync (Phase 7) — SHIPPED 2026-05-14</summary>

- [x] **Phase 7: Reconcile fork capabilities with upstream** — 8 new VcsAdapter verbs (VCS-08..VCS-15 — currentBookmarksIn, mergeBase, diff{diffFilter}, status{cwd}, workspace.merge with atomic main-advance, workspace.remove, bookmarks.delete{force}, readBlob); wave-cleanup executor wired through them; raw-git workflow .md fallbacks deleted; github-release-notes.cjs migrated to cross-backend; strict-green test triage on both backends. (5/5 plans). Full details: `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`.

## Progress

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Status      | Shipped     |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| v1.0 MVP  | 8      | 53/56 | Complete    | 2026-05-14  |
| v1.1 first upstream sync | 1 | 5/5 | Complete | 2026-05-14 |

## Next

Run `/gsd-new-milestone` to start v1.2. SEED-001 (change-id-only on jj adapter surface) will auto-surface as a candidate during milestone scoping if the milestone theme matches.
