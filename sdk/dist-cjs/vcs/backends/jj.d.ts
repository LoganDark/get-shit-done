/**
 * jj backend implementation of VcsAdapter (Phase 3).
 *
 * Phase 3 D-08 shape commit: every verb is present but throws
 * VcsNotImplementedError. Verb-group plans 03-02..03-06 fill the bodies in
 * the D-10 order: parsers (03-02) -> refs (03-03) -> commit/squash (03-04) ->
 * status/log/diff/findConflicts (03-05) -> push/fetch/workspace (03-06).
 *
 * Invariants enforced by this file (verified via grep in CI):
 *   - JJ-02: argv-array invocation only via `jjArgv()` helper.
 *   - JJ-03 / D-05: `--ignore-working-copy` is NEVER passed. The helper
 *     `jjArgv()` is the single source of mandatory flags; adding the flag
 *     anywhere outside it would be caught by Pitfall 5 in 03-RESEARCH.md.
 *   - SQUASH-05: `jj commit` is NEVER used; squash is the sole commit primitive.
 *
 * Each read method snapshots `@` at start (auto-snapshot — see PITFALLS.md
 * #2). Callers needing safe multi-step state inspection follow the
 * pre-probe discipline from Phase 2.1 D-06 (the `stagedOrUnstaged` pattern
 * in `bin/lib/commands.cjs`).
