## What is GSD Core

GSD Core is a context-engineering and spec-driven development framework that drives AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity CLI, Kimi CLI, Copilot, Cursor, and more) through a disciplined phase loop. It solves [context rot](docs/explanation/context-engineering.md) — the quality degradation that accumulates as an AI fills its context window — by running all heavy research, planning, and execution work in fresh-context subagents while keeping your main session lean.

---

## How it works

Each milestone repeats the same five-step loop, one phase at a time:

1. **Discuss** — capture implementation decisions before anything is planned
2. **Plan** — research, decompose, and verify the plan fits a fresh context window
3. **Execute** — run plans in parallel waves; each executor starts with a clean 200k-token context
4. **Verify** — walk through what was built; diagnose and fix before declaring done
5. **Ship** — create the PR, archive the phase, repeat for the next one

---

## Quickstart

```bash
npx @opengsd/gsd-core@latest
```

The installer prompts for your runtime (Claude Code, OpenCode, Antigravity CLI, Kimi CLI, Kilo, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, and more) and whether to install globally or locally. The installer is required for cross-runtime compatibility — do not copy files from `agents/` or `commands/` directly.

On another runtime or without Node.js? See [Install on your runtime](docs/how-to/install-on-your-runtime.md).

Once installed, start a new project or onboard an existing repo:

```bash
/gsd-new-project   # greenfield project
/gsd-onboard       # existing codebase
```

New here? Follow [Your first project](docs/tutorials/your-first-project.md) for a guided walkthrough from install to first shipped phase, or [Onboarding an existing codebase](docs/tutorials/onboarding-an-existing-codebase.md) for brownfield setup.

> [!NOTE]
> **This is a Jujutsu fork of GSD.**
>
> If you're viewing this repository you're probably looking to use [Jujutsu (`jj`)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) with GSD. Once you install this fork:
>
> 1. Run `jj git init --colocate` in your project (if you don't already have a `.jj/` directory).
> 2. Run `/gsd-migrate-vcs` in your harness of choice — it migrates your existing plans to reference jj change ids instead of git commit ids.
>
> If you're not migrating an existing GSD project to jj, then simply make sure to `jj git init` before you run `/gsd-new-project`, and GSD should pick up and use the Jujutsu backend automatically.
>
> After that, all GSD features should work roughly as expected. If you find any bugs, please [open an issue or pull request](https://github.com/LoganDark/get-shit-done/issues) against this fork.

> [!WARNING]
> You should make sure to always be on an empty revision before running GSD operations. GSD expects to squash changes down selectively, as that is how subagents work in-place. This allows you to work within history rather than only at the head of a branch, as long as it has an empty change to effectively use as the head.

## Why it works

Most AI-coding setups fail at scale because context bloat silently degrades output quality, there is no shared memory between sessions, and nothing verifies that code actually works. GSD Core solves all three: heavy work runs in fresh subagents, structured artifacts like `STATE.md` and `CONTEXT.md` survive session boundaries, and the verify step walks through what was built and generates fix plans before a phase is declared done. See [docs/explanation/context-engineering.md](docs/explanation/context-engineering.md) for the full reasoning.
